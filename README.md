# The Awesome Person Re-Identification Datasets
Person re-identification has drawn intensive attention in the computer vision society in recent decades. As far as we know, this page collects all public datasets that have been tested by person re-identification algorithms. If you use any of them, please refer to the original licence. If you have any suggestions or you want to include your dataset here, please open an issue or pull request.

# [VIPeR](https://vision.soe.ucsc.edu/node/178)
This dataset contains two cameras, each of which captures one image per person. It also provides the viewpoint angle of each image. Although it has been tested by many researchers, it's still one of the most challenging datasets. Ryan Layne provides the attribute annotation of VIPeR here.

# [ETH1,2,3](http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~william/datasets.html)
Different from other datasets collecting images from multiple cameras, ETHZ collects images from a moving camera. Although the viewpoint variance is relatively small, it does have considerable illumination variance, scale variance and occlusion.

# [QMUL iLIDS](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~jason/data/i-LIDS_Pedestrian.tgz)
QMUL iLIDS is based on iLIDS MCTS, a dataset collected in an airport during busy time by a multi-camera CCTV system. Almost every identity has four images from two non-overlapping cameras. This dataset has senarios with heavy occlusion and pose variance.

# [GRID](http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/downloads_qmul_underground_reid.html)
GRID is collected by 8 disjoint cameras in a busy underground station. Each identity has two images from different views and there are more images in the gallery set than the probe set. The image quality of this dataset is fairly poor.

# [CAVIAR4ReID](https://lorisbaz.github.io/caviar4reid.html)
This dataset is extracted from a multi-target tracking dataset CAVIAR, which is collected in a shopping mall by two surveillance cameras with overlapped view field. Among 72 identities, 50 of them have images from two camera views and the rest 22 only from one camera. Images for each identity are carefully selected to maximize the resolustion variance.

# [3DPeS](http://www.openvisor.org/3dpes.asp)
3DPeS dataset is collected by 8 non-overlapped outdoor cameras. Although the original video is provided, researchers always use the selected snapshots to test person re-identification algorithms.

PRID dataset has 385 trajectories from camera A and 749 trajectories from camera B. Among them, only 200 people appear in both cameras. This dataset also has a single shot version, which consists with random selected snapshots. Some trajectories are not well-synchronized, which means the person might "jump" between consecutive frames.

# [RAiD](http://cs-people.bu.edu/dasabir/raid.php)
As a relatively new released dataset, RAiD guaranteed each identity has images in all four non-overlaping cameras. Since two cameras are indoor and the other two are outdoor, the illumination variance is considerably large. Images of each identity are collected in a tracking manner, but the order is not always consistent.

# [MPR Drone](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~rlayne/downloads_qmul_drone_dataset.html)
MPR Drone dataset is not a traditional person person re-identification dataset with images captured across a camera network. Instead, it is collected by a flying drone in both indoor and outdoor environment. Since it only has one camera, the author proposed three different types of evaluation experiments in the original paper. All pedestrian detections are obtained by pyramid feature detection in Piotr Dollar's toolbox. It has two sub-datasets. Dataset 01 has been exhaustively labeled for 113610 detections. Dataset 02 provides the raw frame data for Dataset 01.

# [HDA Person Dataset](http://vislab.isr.ist.utl.pt/hda-dataset/)
HDA dataset is proposed to mimic the real person re-identification system as close as possible. Within it, 85 persons were densely labeled across 13 cameras during 30 mins. In addition to the tight bounding boxes, the author also proivdes the occlusion flag, camera homographies and synchronization. Image qualities are vary from 640x480 to 2560x1600 and FPSs are vary from 1 to 5. A nice evaluation tool is provided to test the re-id algorithm, person detector or both of them. Six different protocols are included to analysis the whole re-id system. Detections from ACF are provided.

# [CASIA Gait Database B](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/Gait%20Databases.asp)
CASIA dataset was created in 2005 and originally used to test gait recognition algorithm. In 2015, Liu et.al reused this dataset to test a gait-based person re-identification algorithm. This dataset is collected by 11 overlapped cameras in different view angles from 0 to 180 degree. Each identity also changes the clothing and carrying condition. Instead of providing bounding boxes, the raw video frames and the silhouette of each frame are given.

# [Market1501](http://www.liangzheng.com.cn/Project/project_reid.html)
It contains a large number of identities and each identity has several images from six dis-joint cameras. This dataset also includes 2793 false alarms from DPM as distractors to mimic the real scenario. Quality of the bounding boxes is worse than CUHK03. Later in the ICCV 2015 release version, 500K distractors are integrated to make this dataset really large scale. In the original paper proposed this dataset, the author also used mAP as an evalution criteria to test the algorithms.

# [Large scale person search](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/PS/dataset.html)
Similar to PRW dataset, the person search dataset is large scale dataset with full frame access and large amount of labeled bounding boxes. It aims to mimic the real scenario of person search. Therefore, to test this dataset, a reliable person detector is needed. To make the dataset more difficult, the gallery part includes frames from hand held camera and movies. Two more subsets, low-resolution subset and occlusion subset, are also released to evalution the affect of those factors.

# [DukeMTMC-reID/DukeMTMC4ReID](http://vision.cs.duke.edu/DukeMTMC/)
The DukeMTMC dataset is a large-scale heavily labeled multi-target multi-camera tracking dataset. In total, more than 2700 people were labeled with unique identities in 8 cameras. With the access to all information (full frames, frame level ground truth, calibration information, etc.), this dataset has a lot of protentials. Based on the released train-validation set, two re-id extension datasets are created. The key difference is the way to generate the bounding boxes. DukeMTMC-reID directly uses the manually labeled ground truth whereas DukeMTMC4ReID adopts Doppia as the person detector.

# [Airport](http://www.northeastern.edu/alert/transitioning-technology/alert-datasets/alert-airport-re-identification-dataset/)
The dataset was created using videos from six cameras of an indoor surveillance network in a mid-sized airport. The cameras cover various parts of a central security checkpoint area and three concourses. Each camera has 768 × 432 pixels and captures video at 30 frames per second. 12-hour long videos from 8 AM to 8 PM were collected from each of these cameras. Under the assumption that each target person takes a limited amount of time to travel through the network, each of these long videos was randomly split into 40 five minute long video clips. Each video clip was then run through a prototype end-to- end re-id system comprised of automatic person detection and tracking algorithms.
